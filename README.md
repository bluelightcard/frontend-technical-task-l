## Task

At bluelightcard we have a large member base that have access to a hug number of discounts. Our members need to see what the latest discounts for different brands/companies are available, with also the ability to filter down to a specific brand/company discount, so that they can use the discount code.

We would like you to build a small app with the following requirements:
 - Display discounts in a grid layout with a maximum of 3 columns.
 - Each discount needs to display the brand logo (images are located in the images folder).
 - Each discount needs to display the following data (provided in the sample json dataset)
   - Brand name along with the discount percentage in the following format "Get 15% discount off Gymshark".
   - Discount description (This is an optional field so please account for this).
   - Discount code.
 - Basic filtering such as
   - Sorting in ascending and descending order of brand name.
   - Sorting in discount percentage for both high and low percentage i.e highest percentage is 15% lowest is 5%.

Would be nice to have but not required for this task:
  - Search field to allow members to search discounts by brand/company name and discount percentage.
  - Provide the ability to copy discount codes.
  - Unit tests for your components.
